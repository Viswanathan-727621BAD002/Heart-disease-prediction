# Heart Disease Prediction Project

This repository contains the code and resources for a Heart Disease Prediction project. The goal is to provide a predictive model for assessing the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on historical data and various health indicators.

## Project Overview

This project uses a linear regression model to predict the risk of heart disease. The model was trained on the Framingham Heart Disease dataset, a well-known dataset in cardiovascular studies, containing information about health indicators that are closely linked to heart disease.

## Features

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: The dataset undergoes thorough EDA to explore feature importance and relationships.
2. **Predictive Modeling**: A linear regression model is used to calculate risk scores for heart disease.
3. **User Interface**: A web application that allows users to enter their health data and receive a heart disease risk prediction.

## Dataset

The Framingham Heart Study dataset contains various health indicators for thousands of individuals, including:
- Age, gender, cholesterol levels
- Blood pressure levels, smoking status, diabetes status
- Other risk factors associated with cardiovascular health

The dataset has been preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize data, and remove irrelevant features.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `flask`
